## Code Style

- This is a **Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind** project
- Prefer functional React components and hooks
- Keep components focused; split large ones when it improves clarity
- Use `npm run lint` to catch style and TypeScript issues
- Follow existing patterns before introducing new ones

---

## Commit & PR Guidelines

- Use small, focused commits
- PR titles should roughly follow the same convention as commits
- A PR should do **one logical thing** — avoid drive‑by changes
- Include screenshots or gifs for visual/UI changes
- Link any related issues in the PR description
