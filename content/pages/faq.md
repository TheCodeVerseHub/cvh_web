## Bots & Commands

### How do I use bot commands?

Most bots use slash commands (`/`). Type `/` in the designated bot channel to see available commands. Some bots may use specific prefixes which will be mentioned in their instructions.

### What is considered off-topic?

Any message not related to the channel's purpose. For example, posting memes in help forums or talking about food in development discussions. Please use the appropriate lobby, gaming, or media channels for casual chat.
