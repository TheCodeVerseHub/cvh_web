> Privacy and security of member data is one of our top priorities. This document details what data CodeVerse Hub ("we", "us", or "our") stores on you as a member of our community.

## What Data Do We Store?

- **User Information** — We store Discord User IDs, usernames, and discriminators to identify you across our services
- **Infraction Records** — When a user breaches our rules, we store a record of the infraction (warn/ban/kick) linked to their User ID. This is essential for moderation history
- **ModMail Logs** — All messages sent to our ModMail bot are stored to facilitate support and moderation oversight
- **Message Logs** — We do not permanently store general chat logs. However, deleted messages may be temporarily logged for moderation review

---

## Assurance on Processing

- **Data Minimization** — We only store data that is critical to the operation of our community and the safety of our members
- **Access Control** — Direct access to the database is limited to the Owner. Infraction and ModMail data is accessible to Moderators and Admins strictly for moderation purposes

> We never sell, share, or distribute your data to third parties.

## Your Rights

- **Access** — You may request a copy of the data we hold on you by contacting us
- **Deletion** — You may request deletion of your data. We will comply unless the data is required for moderation purposes (e.g., active ban records)
